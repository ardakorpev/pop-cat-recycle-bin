## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Icons not showing?** Press F5 or restart your computer  
**Script won't run?** Right-click → "Run as administrator"  
**Want original icons back?** Delete this registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\DefaultIcon`

## 💡 Fun Fact

The script automatically saves your icons to a safe folder, so even if you delete everything, your Pop Cat will keep working! No more white paper icons of doom! 

## 🎨 Want Different Cats?

Replace the `.ico` files with your own! The script auto-detects any icons with "open" and "closed" in the filename.
